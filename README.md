## Little Man Computer in Prolog

The **[Little Man Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer)** (LMC) is an instructional model of a computer, created by Dr. Stuart Madnick in 1965. 
The LMC is generally used to teach students, because it models a simple von Neumann architecture computerâ€”which has all of the basic features of a modern computer. 
It can be programmed in machine code (albeit in decimal rather than binary) or assembly code.


Project work carryed out during my Bachelor degree.
